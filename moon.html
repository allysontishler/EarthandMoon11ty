      <h1>Moon</h1>
      <p>The Moon, Earth's natural satellite, is much smaller than the Earth, with a diameter of about 3,474 kilometers. Composed mainly of silicate rock and dust, the Moon lacks a substantial atmosphere and experiences extreme temperature variations. It is thought to have formed around 4.5 billion years ago through a giant impact, where a Mars-sized body collided with the early Earth, ejecting debris that eventually formed into the Moon. As the Earth's constant companion, the Moon's gravitational influence plays a crucial role in stabilizing our planet's axial tilt and governing tides. The Moon's surface is marked by impact craters, vast plains, and mountainous terrains. The image to the right represents the relative size of the Earth compared to the Moon.
