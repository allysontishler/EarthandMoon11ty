      <h1>Earth</h1>
      <p>Earth is the fifth-largest planet in our solar system with a diameter of approximately 12,742 kilometers, thus making it significantly larger than the Moon. Composed primarily of silicate rock and metal, Earth formed approxamately 4.5 billion years ago through a process known as accretion - smaller particles and planetismals collide and fuse together. Earth's atmosphere, rich in nitrogen and oxygen, supports a vast array of life forms, making it a haven for biodiversity. Earth is composed of distinct layers, including a solid inner core, a liquid outer core, a semi-solid mantle and a solid crust.
